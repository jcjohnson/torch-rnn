# torch-rnn
torch-rnn provides high-performance, reusable RNN and LSTM modules for torch7, and uses these modules for character-level
language modeling similar to [char-rnn](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn).

You can find documentation for the RNN and LSTM modules [here](doc/modules.md); they have no dependencies other than `torch`
and `nn`, so they should be easy to integrate into existing projects.

Compared to char-rnn, torch-rnn is up to **1.9x faster** and uses up to **7x less memory**. For more details see 
the [Benchmark](#benchmarks) section below.


# Installation

## Docker Images
Cristian Baldi has prepared Docker images for both CPU-only mode and GPU mode;
you can [find them here](https://github.com/crisbal/docker-torch-rnn).

## System setup
You'll need to install the header files for Python 2.7 and the HDF5 library. On Ubuntu you should be able to install
like this:

```bash
sudo apt-get -y install python2.7-dev
sudo apt-get install libhdf5-dev
```

## Python setup
The preprocessing script is written in Python 2.7; its dependencies are in the file `requirements.txt`.
You can install these dependencies in a virtual environment like this:

```bash
virtualenv .env                  # Create the virtual environment
source .env/bin/activate         # Activate the virtual environment
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install Python dependencies
# Work for a while ...
deactivate                       # Exit the virtual environment
```

## Lua setup
The main modeling code is written in Lua using [torch](http://torch.ch); you can find installation instructions
[here](http://torch.ch/docs/getting-started.html#_). You'll need the following Lua packages:

- [torch/torch7](https://github.com/torch/torch7)
- [torch/nn](https://github.com/torch/nn)
- [torch/optim](https://github.com/torch/optim)
- [lua-cjson](https://luarocks.org/modules/luarocks/lua-cjson)
- [torch-hdf5](https://github.com/deepmind/torch-hdf5)

After installing torch, you can install / update these packages by running the following:

```bash
# Install most things using luarocks
luarocks install torch
luarocks install nn
luarocks install optim
luarocks install lua-cjson

# We need to install torch-hdf5 from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/deepmind/torch-hdf5
cd torch-hdf5
luarocks make hdf5-0-0.rockspec
```

### CUDA support (Optional)
To enable GPU acceleration with CUDA, you'll need to install CUDA 6.5 or higher and the following Lua packages:
- [torch/cutorch](https://github.com/torch/cutorch)
- [torch/cunn](https://github.com/torch/cunn)

You can install / update them by running:

```bash
luarocks install cutorch
luarocks install cunn
```

## OpenCL support (Optional)
To enable GPU acceleration with OpenCL, you'll need to install the following Lua packages:
- [cltorch](https://github.com/hughperkins/cltorch)
- [clnn](https://github.com/hughperkins/clnn)

You can install / update them by running:

```bash
luarocks install cltorch
luarocks install clnn
```

## OSX Installation
Jeff Thompson has written a very detailed installation guide for OSX that you [can find here](http://www.jeffreythompson.org/blog/2016/03/25/torch-rnn-mac-install/).

# Usage
To train a model and use it to generate new text, you'll need to follow three simple steps:

## Step 1: Preprocess the data
You can use any text file for training models. Before training, you'll need to preprocess the data using the script
`scripts/preprocess.py`; this will generate an HDF5 file and JSON file containing a preprocessed version of the data.

If you have training data stored in `my_data.txt`, you can run the script like this:

```bash
python scripts/preprocess.py \
  --input_txt my_data.txt \
  --output_h5 my_data.h5 \
  --output_json my_data.json
```

This will produce files `my_data.h5` and `my_data.json` that will be passed to the training script.

There are a few more flags you can use to configure preprocessing; [read about them here](doc/flags.md#preprocessing)

## Step 2: Train the model
After preprocessing the data, you'll need to train the model using the `train.lua` script. This will be the slowest step.
You can run the training script like this:

```bash
th train.lua -input_h5 my_data.h5 -input_json my_data.json
```

This will read the data stored in `my_data.h5` and `my_data.json`, run for a while, and save checkpoints to files with 
names like `cv/checkpoint_1000.t7`.

You can change the RNN model type, hidden state size, and number of RNN layers like this:

```bash
th train.lua -input_h5 my_data.h5 -input_json my_data.json -model_type rnn -num_layers 3 -rnn_size 256
```

By default this will run in GPU mode using CUDA; to run in CPU-only mode, add the flag `-gpu -1`.

To run with OpenCL, add the flag `-gpu_backend opencl`.

There are many more flags you can use to configure training; [read about them here](doc/flags.md#training).

## Step 3: Sample from the model
After training a model, you can generate new text by sampling from it using the script `sample.lua`. Run it like this:

```bash
th sample.lua -checkpoint cv/checkpoint_10000.t7 -length 2000
```

This will load the trained checkpoint `cv/checkpoint_10000.t7` from the previous step, sample 2000 characters from it,
and print the results to the console.

By default the sampling script will run in GPU mode using CUDA; to run in CPU-only mode add the flag `-gpu -1` and
to run in OpenCL mode add the flag `-gpu_backend opencl`.

There are more flags you can use to configure sampling; [read about them here](doc/flags.md#sampling).

#Resuming
Every checkpoint automatically saves a resume point. All parameters and the *current* learning rate are saved within.
To pick up from that checkpoint, run the train script like this:

```bash
th train.lua -resume_from cv/checkpoint_10000_resume.json
```

# Benchmarks
To benchmark `torch-rnn` against `char-rnn`, we use each to train LSTM language models for the tiny-shakespeare dataset
with 1, 2 or 3 layers and with an RNN size of 64, 128, 256, or 512. For each we use a minibatch size of 50, a sequence 
length of 50, and no dropout. For each model size and for both implementations, we record the forward/backward times and 
GPU memory usage over the first 100 training iterations, and use these measurements to compute the mean time and memory 
usage.

All benchmarks were run on a machine with an Intel i7-4790k CPU, 32 GB main memory, and a Titan X GPU.

Below we show the forward/backward times for both implementations, as well as the mean speedup of `torch-rnn` over 
`char-rnn`. We see that `torch-rnn` is faster than `char-rnn` at all model sizes, with smaller models giving a larger
speedup; for a single-layer LSTM with 128 hidden units, we achieve a **1.9x speedup**; for larger models we achieve about
a 1.4x speedup.

Below we show the GPU memory usage for both implementations, as well as the mean memory saving of `torch-rnn` over
`char-rnn`. Again `torch-rnn` outperforms `char-rnn` at all model sizes, but here the savings become more significant for
larger models: for models with 512 hidden units, we use **7x less memory** than `char-rnn`.

# TODOs
- Get rid of Python / JSON / HDF5 dependencies?
